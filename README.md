# Freelance Invoice — Mobile-first Invoicing & Payment Tracker

Create invoices in under 60 seconds and track payments without spreadsheets, messy templates, or awkward follow-ups.

**Overview**

-   **Purpose:** A lightweight, mobile-first tool that helps freelancers create, share, and track invoices quickly and confidently.
-   **Target users:** Freelancers, consultants, creatives, and small service providers who want a fast, reliable way to invoice and follow up.

**Problem We Solve**

-   **Missed payments:** Stop losing income to forgotten or overdue invoices.
-   **Slow invoice creation:** Replace time-consuming Canva/Word workflows with a one-screen invoice creator.
-   **Scattered client info:** Keep client contact details and invoice history in one place instead of searching chats or Notes.
-   **Awkward reminders:** Provide one-tap reminder text to help freelancers follow up professionally.

**MVP Scope — Revision 1**This release focuses tightly on the essential flow: Create → Share → Track. The goal is to validate demand quickly with a simple, dependable product.

-   **Create Invoice (under 60 seconds):**
    
    -   **Fields:** Client name, service description, amount, due date.
    -   **Convenience:** Auto-generated invoice number and auto-saved client info for repeat billing.
-   **Instant PDF Invoice:**
    
    -   Clean, minimal, professional PDF output optimized for mobile.
    -   Download or share via WhatsApp and email.
-   **Payment Tracking:**
    
    -   Track invoice status using three states: Paid, Pending, Overdue.
    -   Overdue items are surfaced and sorted by oldest first to prioritize follow-ups.
-   **One-Tap Reminder Message:**
    
    -   Copy a professional WhatsApp reminder message with a single tap — no automation required for MVP.
-   **Simple Mobile Dashboard:**
    
    -   At-a-glance totals: Total Paid, Total Pending, Total Overdue.
    -   Prominent “Create Invoice” action for fast workflows.

**Design Principles**

-   **Mobile-first:** Optimized UI/UX for phones — fast, minimal, thumb-friendly.
-   **Zero friction:** Reduce fields and decisions so invoices are created in seconds.
-   **Privacy-first:** No third-party integrations in MVP; client data stays local to the app.
-   **Practical over packed:** Build only what solves the core problem now — avoid feature bloat.

**How It Works (Core Flow)**

-   **Create:** Enter client, service, amount, and due date. The app generates an invoice number and saves the client record.
-   **Share:** Export a clean PDF and share it directly via WhatsApp or email from your phone.
-   **Track:** Mark invoices as Paid, view Pending, and see Overdue items sorted to take action.

**What This MVP Intentionally Avoids**

-   No automation or scheduled reminders.
-   No payment gateway integrations or bank reconciliation.
-   No AI features or advanced reporting — these are deliberate omissions to validate core demand first.

**Project Status & Next Steps**

-   **Current:** Revision 1 (MVP) — UX and core features prioritized.
-   **Next:** User testing with freelancers, iterate on small UX improvements, then evaluate demand for optional features (exporting, templates, simple integrations).
